# Deployment-Shell

Static web-site deployment mechanism written in Perl. Used to grant web-site content 
developers access to deploy content directly from a code repository from a custom login shell.
The shell also gives access to restart a web-server (Apache) and deploy and restart an
application server (Jboss).
